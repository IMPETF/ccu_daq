**CAUTION!**

Programs use pdcurses need to be compiled using the same flags and definition as pdcurses itself.
It means that you:

1)need to link against system library: user32.lib advapi32.lib
2)need to add these macro defition as long as the pdcurses library you use has been built using the
  same macro: -DPDC_WIDE -DPDC_FORCE_UTF8 -DPDC_DLL_BUILD

If you didn't follow these rules,your program may be compiled,but can't be run successfully!
